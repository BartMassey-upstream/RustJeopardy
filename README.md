# Rust Jeopardy

## About

This is a barebones application with the funcitonality of a standard Jeopardy-style game.

It was made for a "Mario Jeopardy" usage, and so features data to this extent, but should be
written in a modifiable way such that one can use their own text data.

This is written in Rust, using the Bevy engine.

## Usage

This is a rather basic Rust setup, so usage should be straight-forward.

I will note for those looking at the code that this is my first Rust application, so if anything
seems off or strange then it probably just is.

This was written with version 1.54.0 installed, and should be able to be run standardly with "cargo run".
